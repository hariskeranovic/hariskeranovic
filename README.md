#Project # Final Project Submission

Semester: Fall 2024

#Overview
The code is going to ask you what want to either decrypt or encrypt. When the code is ran you will be given the option to run the letter E or D,
then you choose your words or phrase and then you will be able type key in the next line and itll either encrypt or decrypt. 

#Reflection
The challenges I was faced with was debugging my code and figuring out how to make it work.
I really struggled with debugging and started looking for every way it could be wrong, 
although now the code works I still have some tweaks to make to it. 
-I think writing the code was something I was familar with and made it simlpier for me. 
-For me debugging and constantly adding new code, after I did a ton of google research
I found code that I could possibly use in my project after altering it a little.
-One thing I would tell myself before starting this project would definelty be to
do a little more reading online and figure out what the purpose of each line of code fully means.

#Compiling and Using

When code is recieved run the program. You will be asked whether you want to encrypt or decrpyt with the letters E and D.
After choosing one you then be asked what word you want ran. From there you want to type key in the next line and it will pop up.
